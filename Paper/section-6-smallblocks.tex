\section{Latency of datasets with many small blocks}

In all CMS processing activities, the growth of a CMS dataset to be
intended as a collection of files with specific physics content
happens through the contribution of production efforts by different
WLCG sites supporting the CMS workflows, and in many cases sites
contributing to a dataset are not the final destination where such
dataset is supposed to be stored. Hence, a PhEDEx subscription is made
to a tape endpoint and possibly to some disk endpoints to gather all
produced data into the needed places according to CMS
policies. However, some of the blocks might be located at a
problematic site that can cause latency in dataset level transfers.

The underlying problem can be missing/corrupt files, or storage
related problems as mentioned in other latency types.

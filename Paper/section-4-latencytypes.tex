\section{Types of latency}

Possible sources of latency, the signals we are looking for
\begin{itemize}
\item tails in large blocks due to stuck files
\item small stuck blocks in large datasets with many blocks
\item blocks that get stuck early in their transfer
\item as many others as we can think of!
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

PhEDEx is one of the crucial components of the CMS Computing
system. Proting of data collection and filtering since Run-1, the
CMS Computing project has a large set of data concerning the latencies
as observed in all transfers happening between all Tiers. The study of
this data set has just started, but it is already allowing a
categorisation of the different root sources of such latencies and
shaping different strategies to attach the observed problem, and this
increase the overall performance of the PhEDEx system for CMS.
